# Tabletop Creator Starter

This project is a minimal starter built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), [React](https://react.dev/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). It provides a responsive landing page layout that you can extend into the full **Tabletop Creator** experience.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open <http://localhost:5173> to view the development build.

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` – start the Vite development server
- `npm run build` – type-check and build the production bundle
- `npm run preview` – preview the production build locally
- `npm run lint` – run ESLint using the recommended TypeScript + React configuration
