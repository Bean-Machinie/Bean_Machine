﻿# Physics Simulation Studio - Product Vision

Physics Simulation Studio is a professional authoring environment for creating, simulating, and rendering educational physics scenarios, with a first-class focus on orbital mechanics.

## Who it is for
- Educators creating explainers and course material
- Researchers and communicators producing consistent, accurate visualizations
- Video creators who need repeatable, high-quality renders

## Why it wins
- Deterministic simulations: every run is reproducible
- Authoring-first UX: direct manipulation and fast iteration
- Clean architecture: headless core engine, extensible render and UI layers
- Scenario format as a stable API: versioned, backward compatible
- Video pipeline as a first-class feature: camera choreography, overlays, and export controls

## What v1 delivers
- Deterministic fixed-step simulation with gravity, thrust, and scheduled events
- Scenario schema v1 with migrations
- Headless CLI runner with trajectory output
- GUI skeleton focused on authoring foundations
- Test coverage for determinism

## What v1 explicitly excludes
- Real-time collision/contact resolution
- Multiplayer or networked collaboration
- Arbitrary scripting that bypasses determinism
